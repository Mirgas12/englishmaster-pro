  "text": "Yesterday was my birthday! I am 11 years old now. My parents had a party for me. All my friends came to my house. There were balloons everywhere. The cake was chocolate - my favorite! We played games and listened to music. I got many presents. My best present was a new bike from my parents. It is red and very fast. We ate pizza and drank lemonade. At the end, we sang \"Happy Birthday.\" It was the best day ever! I can't wait for next year!",
