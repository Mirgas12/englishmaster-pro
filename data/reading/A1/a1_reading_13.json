  "text": "I live in a small town called Greenville. It has about 5,000 people. There is one main street with shops and cafés. We have a library, a post office, and a bank. The hospital is on Oak Street. My favorite place is the ice cream shop. They have the best chocolate ice cream! There is a cinema too, but it only has one screen. The town is quiet and safe. Everyone knows everyone. I love living here, but I want to visit a big city someday.",
