  "text": "Today I go to the park with my dad. The park is near our house. We walk there in 10 minutes. The park has many trees and flowers. There is a big playground with swings and slides. I love the swings! There is also a pond with ducks. We bring bread to feed the ducks. My dad and I sit on a bench and eat ice cream. The sun is warm and the birds are singing. It is a perfect day!",
