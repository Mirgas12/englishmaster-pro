  "text": "I go to Lincoln Primary School. My school is big and has many classrooms. I am in class 5B. My teacher is Mrs. Brown. She is very nice. My favorite subject is art because I love drawing. I also like music and P.E. Math is difficult for me, but I try hard. We have lunch at 12 o'clock in the cafeteria. After lunch, we have more lessons. School finishes at 3 o'clock. I walk home with my friends. I like my school!",
