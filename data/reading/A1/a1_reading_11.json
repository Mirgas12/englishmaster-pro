  "text": "I have many hobbies. I love playing video games. My favorite game is Minecraft. I play it every day after homework. I also like reading books. I read before bed. Fantasy books are my favorite. On weekends, I play football with my friends in the park. I'm not very good, but it's fun. I also like drawing. I draw pictures of animals and superheroes. My mum says I am very creative. What are your hobbies?",
