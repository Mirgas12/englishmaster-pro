  "text": "My favorite sport is basketball. I play it three times a week. My team is called the Tigers. We practice on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Our coach is Mr. Garcia. He is very tall and plays very well. I am the shortest player on the team, but I am fast! My favorite player is LeBron James. I watch NBA games on TV. Last week, we won a game 45 to 38. I was so happy! I want to be a professional player someday.",
