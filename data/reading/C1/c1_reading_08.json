  "text": "The internet's technical architecture embodies certain values and enables certain possibilities while foreclosing others. Understanding how the internet works – not just using it but grasping its underlying structure – is increasingly necessary for informed participation in digital society.\n\nThe fundamental design principle is the 'end-to-end' architecture. Intelligence resides at the endpoints (devices) rather than in the network itself. The network simply moves packets of data without understanding or filtering their contents. This design maximizes flexibility and innovation – new applications can be deployed without changing the network infrastructure.\n\nPacket switching, rather than dedicated circuits, enables this flexibility. Data is broken into packets that travel independently through the network, reassembled at the destination. This allows resilient, efficient use of capacity. If one path is blocked or congested, packets route around the obstacle.\n\nThe protocol stack – layers of standardized communication rules – enables interoperability. At the bottom, physical layers handle electrical signals and hardware. Higher layers manage routing, reliable delivery, and finally applications. Each layer provides services to the layer above without requiring knowledge of layers below.\n\nDomain name systems translate human-readable addresses into numeric IP addresses, enabling navigation. This centralized infrastructure creates potential chokepoints where traffic can be monitored or blocked. Who controls naming systems exercises considerable power.\n\nOriginal internet design assumed good faith among participants – appropriate for its initial academic context but problematic as usage expanded. Security was added as an afterthought rather than built in, creating vulnerabilities that persist today. Email, for instance, lacks built-in authentication, enabling spam and phishing.\n\nNet neutrality – the principle that networks should treat all traffic equally rather than prioritizing or blocking based on content or source – is hotly contested. Advocates argue it preserves the internet's open, innovative character. Critics contend it prevents networks from efficiently managing traffic and developing new business models.\n\nThe internet is not a single thing but a network of networks operated by diverse entities – backbone providers, access networks, content delivery networks – with varying interests and incentives. Governance occurs through multistakeholder bodies, commercial relationships, and technical coordination, not centralized authority.\n\nThis architecture was not inevitable but reflected choices by its designers – choices increasingly revisited as the internet's importance grows. Proposals for alternative architectures, whether for security, privacy, or control, illuminate how technical design embeds and enables political values.",
