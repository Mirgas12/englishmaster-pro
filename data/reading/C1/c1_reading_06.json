  "text": "Economic inequality within countries has increased significantly in recent decades across much of the developed world. While economists continue to debate causes and consequences, the political salience of inequality has never been higher. Understanding its dynamics is essential for informed citizenship.\n\nSeveral factors have driven rising inequality. Technological change has increased demand for skilled workers while displacing routine jobs, widening wage gaps. Globalization has similarly benefited those with globally tradable skills while exposing others to international competition. Declining unionization has weakened workers' bargaining power. Tax policies have in many countries shifted to favor capital over labor.\n\nCapital's growing share of income relative to labor is particularly significant. When wealth accumulates across generations while labor income remains relatively flat, inheritance increasingly determines economic outcomes. Thomas Piketty's influential analysis suggests that when returns on capital exceed economic growth – a historically normal situation that recent decades of high growth may have obscured – inequality tends to increase.\n\nThe consequences of inequality extend beyond distribution alone. Substantial evidence links inequality to reduced social mobility, poorer health outcomes, and increased social problems. Countries with higher inequality tend to have lower trust, higher crime, and reduced civic participation. These relationships persist even when controlling for absolute income levels.\n\nHowever, some argue that inequality incentivizes effort and innovation. If rewards are compressed, why take risks or work hard? This tension between equality and efficiency has long animated economic policy debates. Different societies resolve it differently, reflecting varying cultural values about fairness and opportunity.\n\nMeasurement complexities complicate analysis. Inequality of income differs from inequality of wealth, which differs from inequality of consumption or wellbeing. Before-tax market income inequality differs from after-tax-and-transfer income inequality. Which measure matters depends on which question is being asked.\n\nPolicy responses vary dramatically. Progressive taxation redistributes income directly. Education investments aim to expand opportunity. Minimum wages and labor regulations shape market outcomes before redistribution. Different approaches reflect different diagnoses: is inequality primarily about skills, bargaining power, inherited wealth, or something else?\n\nGlobal inequality presents yet another picture. While inequality within many countries has grown, inequality between countries has declined as developing economies have grown rapidly. Global poverty has fallen dramatically. Whether this matters more than domestic inequality is a matter of moral perspective.\n\nEconomic inequality is not merely a technical matter for economists to resolve but a question about what kind of societies we want to create and what we owe each other.",
