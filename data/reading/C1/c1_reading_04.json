  "text": "Modern consumer societies have embraced choice as an unqualified good. More options, we assume, means greater satisfaction – the ability to find precisely what best suits our preferences. Yet psychological research suggests that beyond a certain point, increasing choice actually diminishes wellbeing. This counterintuitive finding has implications far beyond the supermarket aisle.\n\nBarry Schwartz's influential work distinguishes 'maximizers' from 'satisficers.' Maximizers seek the best possible option, exhaustively evaluating alternatives. Satisficers have criteria and choose the first option that meets them. Intuitively, maximizing seems like the superior strategy. In practice, maximizers tend to be less happy than satisficers, plagued by regret over options not chosen and uncertainty about whether they truly found the best.\n\nExcessive choice imposes cognitive costs. Evaluating many options requires time and mental effort. Decision fatigue can result, leaving people depleted for subsequent choices. Some respond by avoiding decisions altogether – a phenomenon observed in retirement savings plans where more investment options reduce participation.\n\nOpportunity costs become psychologically salient with abundant choice. Every decision means forgoing alternatives, and the more alternatives exist, the greater the accumulated sacrifice seems. This sense of loss can overshadow satisfaction with the chosen option.\n\nAdaptation and comparison further erode satisfaction. We adapt to new possessions quickly, diminishing their pleasure. Meanwhile, awareness of superior alternatives – more readily available with extensive choice – provides unfavorable reference points. The 'best' becomes the enemy of the 'good.'\n\nNevertheless, choice remains valuable within limits. Autonomy – the sense of controlling one's life – contributes to wellbeing, and meaningful choices are expressions of autonomy. The problem isn't choice itself but excessive, inconsequential choice that creates burden without corresponding benefit.\n\nSocieties might consider how to structure choices to promote wellbeing rather than merely maximize options. Default options, which make one choice easier while preserving freedom, can guide people toward good outcomes without eliminating choice. Curating rather than proliferating options can reduce overwhelm while maintaining meaningful selection.\n\nFor individuals, strategies include deliberately limiting options considered, cultivating gratitude for chosen options, and accepting 'good enough' rather than pursuing the best. Recognizing that maximizing breeds dissatisfaction can itself reduce its power.\n\nThe paradox of choice doesn't invalidate freedom or autonomy. Rather, it suggests that the relationship between choice and wellbeing is more complex than liberal ideology assumes. More isn't always better, and sometimes less is liberating.",
