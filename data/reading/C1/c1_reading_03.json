  "text": "Advances in genetic engineering, particularly CRISPR gene-editing technology, have moved possibilities once relegated to science fiction into the realm of near-term reality. We can now contemplate editing human embryos to eliminate genetic diseases, enhancing human capabilities, and even bringing back extinct species. These capabilities raise profound ethical questions that society has barely begun to address.\n\nThe case for therapeutic genetic intervention seems compelling. If we can prevent children from inheriting debilitating genetic conditions – Huntington's disease, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia – shouldn't we do so? Parents already screen for genetic conditions; why is directly correcting problematic genes morally different? The argument from preventing suffering provides powerful justification for therapeutic applications.\n\nHowever, drawing a line between therapy and enhancement proves challenging. Correcting a mutation that causes dwarfism seems therapeutic, but what about increasing a child's height beyond the normal range? Eliminating a gene associated with early Alzheimer's is therapeutic, but what about boosting cognitive capacity beyond typical levels? The therapy/enhancement distinction, though intuitive, becomes increasingly blurry upon examination.\n\nConcerns about inequality loom large. If genetic enhancements become available, they will initially be accessible only to the wealthy. This could create biological classes, with enhanced individuals enjoying compounding advantages across generations. Such a scenario could entrench inequality far more deeply than current social structures.\n\nThe question of consent is particularly vexed. Modified individuals cannot consent to changes that will affect their entire lives and those of their descendants. Parents routinely make consequential decisions for children who cannot consent, but genetic modifications are irrevocable in ways that other choices are not.\n\nEugenics – the discredited program of 'improving' human populations through selective breeding – casts a long shadow over these debates. While contemporary genetic engineering differs from historical eugenics in important respects, the specter of past abuses counsels caution about who decides what counts as improvement and who bears the consequences of getting it wrong.\n\nDe-extinction – resurrecting species like woolly mammoths through genetic engineering – raises distinct questions about our obligations to existing ecosystems and the definition of species identity. Is a genetically reconstructed mammoth truly a mammoth if it was gestated by an elephant and raised outside its original ecological context?\n\nNavigating these dilemmas requires wisdom that current institutions may lack. Scientific capabilities are advancing faster than ethical frameworks and regulatory structures can adapt. The stakes – for human identity, equality, and our relationship with nature – could hardly be higher.",
