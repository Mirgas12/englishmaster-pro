  "text": "I went to my first concert last night! It was a pop band called The Stars. I've listened to their music for years, so I was very excited. My older sister bought the tickets as a present for my birthday. We arrived early to get a good spot near the stage. The concert started at 8 pm. When the band came on stage, everyone screamed. The lead singer had amazing energy. She danced and sang for two hours! I knew all the songs, so I sang along. My favorite song was \"Flying High.\" The sound was so loud that my ears were ringing afterwards. At one point, the drummer threw his drumsticks into the crowd. I tried to catch them, but I was too short. After the concert, we bought t-shirts from the merchandise stand. I can't stop talking about the concert. I hope I can go to another one soon!",
