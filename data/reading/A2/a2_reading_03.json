  "text": "I got my first part-time job last month. I work at a café near my school. I work there on Saturdays and Sundays. My job is to serve customers and clean tables. On my first day, I was very nervous. I didn't know what to do. But my colleague, Sarah, helped me a lot. She showed me how to use the coffee machine and the cash register. The customers are usually nice, but sometimes people are in a hurry and get impatient. I have learned to stay calm and smile. The best part of the job is getting tips! Last weekend, one customer gave me a five-dollar tip because I helped her with her bags. I save most of my money for college, but I also buy small things for myself. Working has taught me to be responsible and organized. I really enjoy my job!",
