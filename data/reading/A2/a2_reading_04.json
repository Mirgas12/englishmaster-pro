  "text": "Our school is preparing a play. It's called 'Romeo and Juliet' by Shakespeare. I tried out for the role of Juliet, and I got it! I was so excited when the teacher told me. We practice every day after school. It's hard work, but it's also fun. I have to learn many lines. My mum helps me practice at home. She reads Romeo's part while I read mine. The costume designer made a beautiful dress for me. It's red and gold. The play is next Friday. I'm a little nervous because many people will come to watch. My grandparents are coming from another city just to see me! I hope I don't forget my lines. My friend Tom plays Romeo. He's a good actor. After the play, there will be a party for all the actors. I can't wait!",
