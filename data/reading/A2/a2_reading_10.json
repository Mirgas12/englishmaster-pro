  "text": "I started learning Spanish last year. At first, it was very difficult. The pronunciation was strange, and I couldn't remember the vocabulary. But now it's getting easier. I practice every day using an app on my phone. I also watch Spanish cartoons and listen to Spanish music. My favorite singer is from Mexico. I don't understand all the words, but I'm learning! At school, we have Spanish class twice a week. Our teacher, Mrs. Rodriguez, is from Colombia. She only speaks Spanish in class, which is hard but helpful. I can now introduce myself, order food, and ask for directions in Spanish. Last summer, we went to Spain on holiday. I was able to use my Spanish! I ordered ice cream and asked where the beach was. The waiter was impressed. I want to visit Latin America one day and speak Spanish fluently.",
