  "text": "Every week, I go to the public library near my house. It's a quiet, peaceful place. I love the smell of old books! The library has thousands of books on different topics. There are sections for children, teenagers, and adults. I usually go to the young adult section. I like adventure and mystery stories. The librarian, Mrs. Parker, is very helpful. She always recommends good books. Last week, she suggested a book about a detective. I couldn't put it down and finished it in two days! I have a library card, so I can borrow books for free. I can keep them for three weeks. The library also has computers for studying and free Wi-Fi. Sometimes I do my homework there because it's quieter than home. There are also reading groups and events. Next month, a famous author is coming to give a talk. I already signed up!",
