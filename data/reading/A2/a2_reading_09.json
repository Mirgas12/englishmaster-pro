  "text": "It rained all day today, so I stayed home. At first, I was bored. I wanted to play outside with my friends. But then I decided to make the best of it. In the morning, I played video games for an hour. Then I helped my mum bake cookies. We made chocolate chip cookies - my favorite! While they were in the oven, I read a book. It's about a boy who finds a magic door in his bedroom. After lunch, I did a puzzle with my dad. It had 500 pieces and took us two hours to finish. It was a picture of a tropical beach. That made me think about our summer holiday. In the evening, we watched a movie together as a family. We had popcorn and hot chocolate. By the end of the day, I wasn't bored anymore. Rainy days can be fun too!",
