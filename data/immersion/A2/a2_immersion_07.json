  "transcript": "I started my new job last Monday. I work as an assistant in a marketing company. The office is in the city center, on the fifth floor of a big building. My working hours are from nine to five, with a one-hour lunch break. My colleagues are very friendly. They helped me a lot during my first week. My manager, Mr. Wilson, explained my tasks clearly. I mainly answer emails, organize meetings, and help with presentations. The salary is good, and I get twenty days of vacation per year. I'm happy with my new job so far!",
