  "transcript": "Every day I commute to work in the city center. I live in a suburb about twenty kilometers away. First, I walk to the bus stop. It takes about ten minutes. Then I catch the 8:15 bus. The bus ride takes thirty minutes because of the traffic. After that, I take the metro for three stops. Finally, I walk five minutes to my office. The whole journey takes about fifty minutes. Sometimes I read a book on the bus. When it rains, I drive my car, but parking is expensive in the city.",
