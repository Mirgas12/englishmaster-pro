  "transcript": "I want to tell you about my hobby. I love photography! I started taking photos five years ago when I got my first camera as a birthday present. At first, I took pictures of my family and friends. Now I prefer landscape photography. I love going to beautiful places and capturing nature. Last summer, I went to the mountains and took amazing photos of sunrise. I edit my photos on the computer using special software. Sometimes I share them on social media, and people say nice things. Photography helps me relax and see the world differently. Maybe one day I'll have my own exhibition!",
