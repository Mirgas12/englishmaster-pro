  "transcript": "I've been learning English for two years now. It's not always easy, but I enjoy it. I study English in different ways. Three times a week, I take online lessons with a teacher. We practice speaking and learn grammar. I also use apps on my phone every day. They help me learn new words. In the evening, I watch English movies with subtitles. At first, I used subtitles in my language. Now I use English subtitles. It's much better for learning! I also try to read simple books in English. My goal is to speak fluently one day. I want to travel and communicate with people from different countries.",
